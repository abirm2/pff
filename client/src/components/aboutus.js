A marketplace is a platform where vendors can come together to sell their products or 
services to a curated customer base. The role of a marketplace owner is to bring together 
the right vendors and the right customers to drive sales through an exceptional multi-vendor 
platform - sellers have a place to gain visibility and sell their products, and the marketplace
 owner earns a commission from each sale. An online store, on the other hand, is a single store
 selling its own products online. All marketing and operations are managed by the company that owns
  the website and products.Marketplace owners do not own the inventory their platform sells, unlike 
  online store owners. The marketplace owner, therefore, leaves the more operational side of  
  the business to vendors while focusing mainly on promoting their marketplace brand with a view to 
   driving traffic to the platform and converting site views into sales
